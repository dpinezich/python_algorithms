# Comparison of Time complexity

### Bubble sort:
If we have n elements in our list, we would have n iterations per item - thus Bubble Sort's time complexity is O(n^2).

### Selection sort:

The amount of comparisons are (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1, which gives Selection Sort a time complexity of O(n^2).
